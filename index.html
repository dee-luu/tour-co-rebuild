        <h2>Best Street Food and Drink in Hanoi</h2>
        <div class="foodSlider">
            <div class="foodSlide"><a href="https://example.com">
                    <div class="foodCard"><img src="images/banhcuon.jpg" alt="Best Banh Cuon"></div>
                    <h4>Banh Cuon</h4>
                    <p>Bánh cuốn is a northern Vietnamese dish that migrated to Hanoi. Thin steamed rice flour pancakes
                        filled with minced pork and wood ear mushrooms are served with nuoc cham, a fish-sauce-based
                        dipping sauce, fried shallots and fresh herbs. Slightly goopy in texture, banh cuon are often
                        eaten for breakfast or as an evening pick-me-up. </p>
                </a></div>
            <div class="foodSlide"><a href="https://example.com">
                    <div class="foodCard"><img src="images/buncha.jpg" alt="Best Best Bun Cha"></div>
                    <h4>Bun Cha</h4>
                    <p>Possibly the most delicious food available to man, bún chả is the lunch of choice all over Hanoi.
                        Pork patties and slices of pork belly are grilled over hot coals and served with fish sauce,
                        tangy vinegar, sugar and lime, which, when combined, creates a sort of barbecue soup that is
                        eaten with rice vermicelli and fresh herbs. Accompanied by deep-fried spring rolls, this
                        calorically rich dish is served with garlic and chilies on the side for an extra kick. </p>
                </a></div>
            <div class="foodSlide"><a href="https://example.com">
                    <div class="foodCard"><img src="images/bunrieu.jpg" alt="Best Bun Rieu"></div>
                    <h4>Bun Rieu</h4>
                    <p>Freshwater crabs flavor this tangy tomato soup that's made with round rice vermicelli and topped
                        with pounded crabmeat, deep-fried tofu and, often, congealed blood. An odoriferous purple shrimp
                        paste is offered on the side -- it tastes delicious. Chilies and fresh herbs are the finishing
                        touches for a complete one-dish meal. </p>
                </a></div>

                    <div class="foodCard"><img src="images/pho.jpg" alt="Pho"></div>
                    <h4>Pho</h4>
                    <p>As the birthplace of phở, Hanoi is ground zero for the fragrant rice noodle soup served with
                        fresh herbs that has become popular all over the world. It's no surprise, then, that Hanoi's pho
                        is outstanding. Two variations are most popular: pho ga (with chicken) and pho bo (with beef).
                        Pho is traditionally served as a breakfast food, so you'll find pho sellers all over town from
                        before dawn to mid-morning. </p>
                </a></div>
            <div class="foodSlide"><a href="https://example.com">
                    <div class="foodCard"><img src="images/coffee.jpg" alt="Phin Coffee"></div>
                    <h4>Phin Coffee</h4>
                    <p>Coffee was brought to Vietnam by the French and is, along with baguettes, one of their lasting
                        culinary legacies. Beans are grown in Vietnam and roasted, often with lard, before being ground
                        and served in single-serving metal filters. Drinking a cup of cafe nau da, iced coffee with
                        condensed milk, on a busy side street is one of Hanoi's great pleasures. </p>
